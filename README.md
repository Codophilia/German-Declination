# German-Declination.
A `C' code to exercise  german declination.

I've created a C program for exercising and assessing the german declination abilities. It uses string comparison to ask about declination of endings. The 
first file, alle_adj.h is the first exam that covers all three adjective declinations in 20 questions . I'll add other files to cover other topics of 
declination.
 **clang version 10.0.0-4ubuntu1** was used to compile and test the code.Propositions for improving the code are always welcome. To compile the code on 
 Linux run:

`clang file_name.c -o file_name`

or

`cc file_name.c -o file_name`

On other operating systems, compile it as you compile any C code.Then run it by typing `./filename` if the file is in your current directory.
